# Accessibility Task Notes

## Priority checks
- Keep heading order logical within each page section.
- Ensure interactive elements are keyboard reachable.
- Keep visible focus styles on links/buttons.
- Ensure link/button text is descriptive in context.

## Repo-specific checks
- Review `components/Hero.tsx` and CTA links for readable labels.
- Review `components/ExampleListSection.tsx` images for meaningful `alt` text.
- Avoid color-only status cues in badges/tags.
- Preserve contrast in both default and `dark:` classes.

## Quick verification
- Tab through the page at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Verify no obvious keyboard traps in cards/modals/menus.
- Run `pnpm -s lint && pnpm -s typecheck && pnpm -s build`.
- Capture any remaining a11y debt in the PR notes.
